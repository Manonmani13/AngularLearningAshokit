ng new application name-used to create a new application
 to open your code through terminal use this  -> code application name
 to run your application  ->ng serve
 
angular ->cache file 
node_modules-> contain jar for angular
gitignore-> ignore the files
angular.json->for angular configuration it is using
package.json->used to tell that project whole detail 
package.lock.json->it will note that node module details like version.
tsconfig.app.json->it uses to configure the tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json->used to compile the file
tsconfig.spec.json->used for testing 
app.module.ts-> this file controll every file 
index.html -> which is first html file here only we can run our component
main.ts-> which is used to call the every component here 


components
which is sepearte the part 
it contains html

default component is APP
after that only our component will available


angular will perform very fast on dom changes


How app component Works?
it cotains html,css,ts file

ts file contains only logics
if you remove the selector in decorator content -> you cannot able to see output


while giving the ng serve comment -> it will change all typescript file to javascript file

what is WebPAck?
inside the angular there is a tool called webPAck
which help to run your app code ( it will include your typescript code)
it will start the angular

How to create Componet?

two ways is there
1.using cli
2.manually

export key help angular can make use of it.

there is a two key for denotes the html content
1.template - inside templat you must give every code
2.templateURl- used to give url of that particular file


styles-allow you to define inline css style
styleURls- used for external urls

once we registered our component then only our component will consider as componnent

using cli comments
1.ng generate component hello-world (or) ng g c hello-world (project name)
 
Data Binding
there is two way 


1.one way binding -only at the time of variable creation we can change <h1>{{firstName+' '+lastName}}</h1>  ,<h1 [innerText]="firstName='Mano'"></h1>
2.two way binding-

property Binding
-------------------
<h1 [innerText]="title"></h1>
<button [disabled]='isDisabled'>Click me !</button>

which is used to access our html element property

example : innerText

Directives

changes behavior ,apperance or layout of the elements'

pipes
------
if we want to change the original data to another format 
components are directives too
Strcutural Directive-ngFor

ng on changes
------------------
it is not work for arrays,object for that we have to use ngDoCheck

ngDoCheck
--------
it will call everytime whenevery you use keyboard and use

COMPONENT
--------------
component is typescript class which is responsible to handle requests coming from template.
TEMPLATE:
----------

DATABINDING
--------------
data binding is used to bind the data between component and template.component properties will be binded to html elements.

Service:
---------
service is typescript class which contains re-usable business logic.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION
-----------------------
dependency injection is used for injecting service class obj into component class obj.

META DATA
-----------
data about the data is called as Meta data.relation between component and template will be maintained in meta data.

DIRECTIVES
------------
directives are used to mainpulate DOM elements.

PIPES
------
pipes are used to transform the data before displaying in template.

collection of component is called as Module

routings are used to navigate from one page to another page.

Package.json
->represents the configuration settings/meta data of the application
->angular application dependencies will be configure in package.json file
->in package.json file we will have 'dependencies' and 'dev-dependices'
->'dev-dependices' are used for developing angular application and dependices are used for running angular application.

tsconfig.json file
->tsconfig.json file is used to set configuration settings for typescript compiler.
->typescript complier will read tsconfig.file json and then it compile all ts.file into .js file.

tslint.json
->this file contains configuration settings for 'lint' tool which is used to verify weather the typescript files are following a set of coding standard or not.

karma.conf.js
