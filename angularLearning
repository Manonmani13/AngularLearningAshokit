ng new application name-used to create a new application
 to open your code through terminal use this  -> code application name
 to run your application  ->ng serve
 
angular ->cache file 
node_modules-> contain jar for angular
gitignore-> ignore the files
angular.json->for angular configuration it is using
package.json->used to tell that project whole detail 
package.lock.json->it will note that node module details like version.
tsconfig.app.json->it uses to configure the tsconfig.json file
tsconfig.json->used to compile the file
tsconfig.spec.json->used for testing 
app.module.ts-> this file controll every file 
index.html -> which is first html file here only we can run our component
main.ts-> which is used to call the every component here 


components
which is sepearte the part 
it contains html

default component is APP
after that only our component will available


angular will perform very fast on dom changes


How app component Works?
it cotains html,css,ts file

ts file contains only logics
if you remove the selector in decorator content -> you cannot able to see output


while giving the ng serve comment -> it will change all typescript file to javascript file

what is WebPAck?
inside the angular there is a tool called webPAck
which help to run your app code ( it will include your typescript code)
it will start the angular

How to create Componet?

two ways is there
1.using cli
2.manually

export key help angular can make use of it.

there is a two key for denotes the html content
1.template - inside templat you must give every code
2.templateURl- used to give url of that particular file


styles-allow you to define inline css style
styleURls- used for external urls

once we registered our component then only our component will consider as componnent

using cli comments
1.ng generate component hello-world (or) ng g c hello-world (project name)
 
Data Binding
there is two way 


1.one way binding -only at the time of variable creation we can change <h1>{{firstName+' '+lastName}}</h1>  ,<h1 [innerText]="firstName='Mano'"></h1>
2.two way binding-

property Binding
-------------------
<h1 [innerText]="title"></h1>
<button [disabled]='isDisabled'>Click me !</button>

which is used to access our html element property

example : innerText

Directives
------------
changes behavior ,apperance or layout of the elements'

pipes
------
if we want to change the original data to another format 
components are directives too
Strcutural Directive-ngFor

ng on changes
------------------
it is not work for arrays,object for that we have to use ngDoCheck

ngDoCheck
--------
it will call everytime whenevery you use keyboard and use

COMPONENT
--------------
component is typescript class which is responsible to handle requests coming from template.
TEMPLATE:
----------
template is a html file which contains presentation logic

DATABINDING
--------------
data binding is used to bind the data between component and template.component properties will be binded to html elements.

Service:
---------
service is typescript class which contains re-usable business logic.

DEPENDENCY INJECTION
-----------------------
dependency injection is used for injecting service class obj into component class obj.

META DATA
-----------
data about the data is called as Meta data.relation between component and template will be maintained in meta data.

DIRECTIVES
------------
directives are used to mainpulate DOM elements.

PIPES
------
pipes are used to transform the data before displaying in template.

collection of component is called as Module

routings are used to navigate from one page to another page.

To create angular application execute below command in command prompt 
ng new <app-name>

once application got created , nagivate into application folder and execute below command to run angular application.
ng serve


Package.json
->represents the configuration settings/meta data of the application
->angular application dependencies will be configure in package.json file
->in package.json file we will have 'dependencies' and 'dev-dependices'
->'dev-dependices' are used for developing angular application and dependices are used for running angular application.

tsconfig.json file
->tsconfig.json file is used to set configuration settings for typescript compiler.
->typescript complier will read tsconfig.file json and then it compile all ts.file into .js file.

tslint.json
->this file contains configuration settings for 'lint' tool which is used to verify weather the typescript files are following a set of coding standard or not.

karma.conf.js
->this file contains configuration settings for 'karma' tool which is used to execute unit testcases on multiple browsers.

angular.json
->this file contains configuration settings for "@angular/cli" tool which is used for create,complie and run angular applications.
-> it contains settings such as home page(index.html) .startup file (main.ts),css file (Style.css) etc.

index.html
->this file is home page(startup page) for entire application.
->the content of entire  application will be displayed in index.html  file only.

Start up Module in angular

->Angular application can contain any no.of modules
->Angular application execution will begin from 'App Module'.
->'App Module' is called as 'StartUp Module' of angular application.
-> the process of executing startup module is called as 'Boot Strapping'.
	synatx:platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
	
Angular Application Execution Flow
-----------------------------------
->Angular application execution will start from "App Module". it is also called as Bootstraping Module in Angular.
->"App Module" will boot strap  "App Component"
->To access a component we will use component selector.we can find component selector tag in component.ts file
->In Angular application "src/index.html" file will act as welcome file.
->In src/index.html file we will write 'App Component' selector so when index.html file is loaded it will access 'App Componen'
Q)what is componnet?
Ans)Component represents certain section in web page.
->for example:'login form' will be represeneted by "Login Component" ."Registered Form" Will be represented by "Registered Component"

Q)How to create Component in angular application?
Ans)To create a new component we will use below syntax in angular cli.
	ng generate component <component-name>
	or
	ng g c <component-name>
	
	Ex:ng g c login===>Login component will be created
	
Q)What all files will be created in component?
	login.component.ts->(properties & method)
	login.component.html->(presentation)
	login.component.spec.ts->unit testing
	login.component.css->styles

-><Component-name>.component.ts file is a typescript class in that we will write variables and methods to deal with requests.	
properties   ->  to store the data
methods      ->  to perform action

Note: In angular application we can create any no.of components. "app component" is the mandtory component.

@)How to invoke a component in web-page?
Ans) A Component can be invoked using  'selector' tag.We can find selector tag in component.ts file.

@)How to represent type script class as component?
Ans)To represent  Type Script class as component we will use @Component decorator.


->selector represents a tag which is used to invoke the component.
->'templateURl' represents html file that has to be rerendered when the component is invoked.
->'styleUrls' represents css style that should be loaded for template.

Data Binding
-----------
->Data Binding is a technique which is used to establish relation between "component" and "template".
->component is a typescript class
->template is html class
->by using data binding technique we can send data from component class to template file and vice versa
->if component is changed then template will be automatically. if template is changed then the component will be changed automatically 
->Data Bindings are four types.
	1)Interpolation
	2)Property Binding
	3)Event Binding
	4)Two Binding
	
Interpolation
--------------
->it is used to display variable/property value in template
->if variable/property value is changed then immediately it will be updated in the template

	Syntax:{{msg}}

Property Binding
----------------
->property binding is used to send the data from component to template and assign the same into an attribute of tag.
->if the property is changed then immediately it will be updated in template.
Syntax:[attribute]=*property

Event Binding
-------------
->it is used to pass event notification from template to comoponent
syntax:<tag (event)="method()"></tag>

Two-way data binding
--------------------
->it is combination of both property binding and event binding 
->to achieve two way data binding we have ngModal directives.
->two way data binding is applicable only for <input> and <select> tags;
->to use two-way data binding we must import "Form Modules"

--------------------
Import 	 "Form Modules" in app.module.ts file
Declare properties and methods in app.component.ts file
With prensentation Logic in app.component.html file
------------------

Directives
------------
->Directives are used to manipulate DOM  elements.
->Dom stands for Document Object Modal
->Angular Framework provided several predefined directives
----------------------------------------------------------
style
ngClass
ngIf
ngIF and else
ngSwitch
ngFor

->style directives is used to set Css property value dynamically at runtime.when the value of the component property is changed the value of css property will be changed automatically.
->'ngClass' directives is used to set css classname dynamically at runtime.this directives is used to set styles with multiple properties conditional at runtime.
->'ngIf' is used to display an element when condition is true.
->'ngIf and else; is used to display one element when condition 'true; and display anothher element when condition is false.

ngfor
----
->it is used to repeat the tag once for each element in the array.
->we have to prefix '*' before ngFor directives
EX:arrayNAme=[val1,val2,val3]
	<tag *ngFor="let variable of arrayname">
	</tag>
------------------
->service is a class which contains re-usable business logic.
->multiple component classes can access service which contains bussiness logic.

What is web application
------------------------
the applications which are running in the internet are called as web application
Ex:Gmail,flipkart,amazon,naukri,linkedin etc..
web applications are meant for Customer 2 Business communcation
(c2b communication
web application we can divided into 2 types.
1.single page application (SPA)
2.multiplepage application (MPA)

->in spa, web page will be reloaded only for first request,from second request onwards only content will be loaded 
EX:www.angular.io
->in mPA for every request web page will be loaded at client side(it increases burden on browser and server)

Note:Single page application will have rich user experience.

EX:www.axisbank.com
What is angular
---------------
angular is client side framework.
angular is used to develop frontend part of application
	Note::Backend can be ava/.net/python/php/node.js
angular is mainely used to develop single page application
angular is free and open source framework
angular developed by google company
angular support multiple platforms
angular  having browser compatability
angular applications will have both web and mobile compatability.
->we will decoreate service class with @Injectable annotation so that other classes can access service class using @Inject annotation.
angular framework devloped by using typescript
angular framework came into market in the year of 2016.
the current version of angular is 13.

----------------------------------
Angular JS VS Angular FrameWork
--------------------------------
angular js and angular framework  both are not same
angular js developed by google in 2010.
agular js developed by using java script.
angular js 1.0 angular 1.6 ...stopped
angular js having lot of performance issues

Note:google identified drawbacks of angular js and they have re-written angular js compatablity using typescript and released into market in 2016 with same as angular 2.

Note:from angular 2 ...angular 13 (Developed using typescript)

Note:Angular & angular framework both are same
